This block of C++ is responsible for getting MAVlink UAV data in and out of JavaScript.
It builds to make a node module by just doing:
	make

Looks like calling into C++, creating a three-entry array, and returning it out to a JavaScript loop only takes about 1us.  Not bad.  No memory leaks either, which is nice.  It gets a lot slower (up to 8us) with more complex objects, but this time is 100% v8 memory allocation/garbage collection.  Annoying, but still not bad.

Checking in initial version.  Currently does almost nothing, but it successfully returns
a live C++ class out to JavaScript via a funky method derived from my pup technique.
